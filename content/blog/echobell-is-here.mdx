# Echobell is here!

We’re excited to share Echobell with you—an instant alert app that helps you cut through noise and never miss what matters. If you’ve ever missed a build failure, an uptime alert, or an important email, Echobell turns those moments into clear, timely notifications you can trust.

## What is Echobell?

Echobell is a privacy‑first notification app that receives triggers from webhooks or email and delivers the right alert to the right people—instantly. You organize alerts into channels, shape the content with templates, and pick how urgent each notification should be. It’s fast, flexible, and built for real‑world workflows.

In short: create a channel, send it a webhook or an email, and Echobell turns it into a personalized app notification—Normal, Time Sensitive, or even a call‑like alert.

## Key Features

### Notification Channels

At the heart of Echobell are Channels—simple, powerful pipelines for your alerts. Each channel includes:

- Name and color for quick recognition
- Templates for title and body, using variables like `{{server}}`, `{{message}}`, or `{{timestamp}}`
- Triggers via webhook or email
- A shareable subscription link so teammates or followers can subscribe

### Multiple Triggering Methods

Echobell offers two reliable ways to trigger notifications:

**Webhook notifications**: Call your unique URL with GET or POST and Echobell notifies all channel subscribers. Great for:

- Server monitoring alerts
- CI/CD pipeline notifications
- IoT device status updates
- E-commerce order notifications

**Email‑to‑notification**: Send or forward an email to a channel’s address to trigger alerts—no code required. Perfect when:

- Forward important emails as notifications
- Create notification flows without coding
- Integrate with legacy systems that support email but not webhooks

### Customizable Notification Templates

Make alerts meaningful with templates and variables:

```
Title: {{server}} status alert
Body: {{message}} detected at {{timestamp}}
```

Send variables in the webhook body or query string—or rely on email fields like subject, from, and text—to render clear, personalized notifications.

### Flexible Notification Types

Not all alerts are equal. Echobell supports three types:

- **Normal (Active)**: Standard app notifications for routine updates
- **Time Sensitive**: High‑priority alerts that can break through focus modes
- **Calling**: Call‑like notifications for critical incidents

### Privacy-First Approach

Privacy is built in:

- Only accounts, channels, and subscriptions live on our servers
- Notification content and history stay on your devices
- Your sensitive data remains under your control

## Use Cases

Echobell fits many real‑world workflows:

### For Developers

### For Traders

- Mentions and signals via email forwarding

### For Teams
