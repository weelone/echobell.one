# Echobell is here!

Today, we're thrilled to announce the official launch of Echobell – a revolutionary instant alert app designed to transform how you receive and manage notifications.

## What is Echobell?

Echobell is an instant alert application that brings simplicity and power to notification management. In today's world of information overload, staying on top of truly important alerts can be challenging. Echobell solves this by providing a flexible platform that can handle webhooks or emails as triggers, and then deliver customized notifications to you and your subscribers.

The core principle behind Echobell is straightforward: create channels for different types of notifications, customize how those notifications appear, and choose how urgently you want to be alerted.

## Key Features

### Notification Channels
At the heart of Echobell are **Channels** – customizable notification pipelines that you can create for different purposes. Each channel has:
- A unique name and color for easy identification
- Customizable notification templates that determine what information is sent
- Flexible triggering options via webhooks or email
- Shareable subscription links so others can receive your notifications

### Multiple Triggering Methods
Echobell offers two powerful ways to trigger notifications:

**Webhooks**: Integrate with virtually any system by using our webhook URLs. When these URLs are called (with a simple GET or POST request), your channel sends notifications to all subscribers. This is perfect for:
- Server monitoring alerts
- CI/CD pipeline notifications
- IoT device status updates
- E-commerce order notifications

**Email Triggers**: Each channel can have a dedicated email address. When an email is sent to this address, the channel is triggered, and notifications are sent out. This makes it easy to:
- Forward important emails as notifications
- Create notification flows without coding
- Integrate with legacy systems that support email but not webhooks

### Customizable Notification Templates
Make your alerts meaningful by using our template system with dynamic variables:

```
Title: {{server}} status alert
Body: {{message}} detected at {{timestamp}}
```

When triggered with variables like `server=production` and `message=CPU usage at 95%`, the notification becomes personalized and informative.

### Flexible Notification Types
Not all alerts are created equal. Echobell lets subscribers choose from three notification types:

- **Normal**: Standard app notifications for routine alerts
- **Time Sensitive**: High-priority notifications that can break through certain focus modes
- **Calling**: Call-like alerts for critical situations that demand immediate attention

### Privacy-First Approach
We've built Echobell with privacy at its core:
- Only user accounts, channels, and subscription data are stored on our servers
- Notification content and history stay exclusively on your device
- Your sensitive alert data never leaves your control

## Use Cases

Echobell is versatile enough to serve a wide range of notification needs:

### For Developers
- Monitor server health and receive instant alerts when issues arise
- Get notifications when builds complete or tests fail
- Receive alerts when critical errors occur in production

### For Teams
- Create channels for different projects or systems
- Let team members subscribe with their preferred notification urgency
- Ensure critical alerts are never missed, even during focus time

### For Personal Use

- Receive notifications for important emails without checking your inbox
- Create custom alerts for anything important to you
