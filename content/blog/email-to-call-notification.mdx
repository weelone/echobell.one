# Turn important emails into call notifications with Echobell

We all have that one email we simply can’t miss. Echobell turns those critical emails into call-style, time‑sensitive notifications that actually ring your phone—so you hear them even when you’re heads‑down or in a focus mode. Perfect for production incidents, VIP senders, billing failures, and on‑call developer alerts.

What you’ll get by the end:

- An Echobell channel triggered by email
- Human‑friendly templates that get read aloud in call notifications
- Time‑sensitive calling notifications with optional retries
- Smart Conditions to filter by sender, subject, or keywords
- Simple mail forwarding rules for Gmail, iCloud Mail, or Outlook

A quick note on privacy: Echobell is privacy‑first. We store only your account, channels, and subscriptions; notification content and records stay on your devices.

## Prerequisites

- Install Echobell from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198
- Allow notification permission

## Step 1 — Create a channel

1. Open Echobell → New Channel
2. Give it a name and color (for example, “Critical Email Alerts”)
3. Save

## Step 2 — Bind the email trigger

On the channel detail page, copy the dedicated email address. Any email sent to this address triggers the channel instantly.

When an email triggers a channel, these template variables are available:

- `from`: sender address
- `to`: channel‑bound address
- `subject`: email subject
- `text`: plain‑text body
- `html`: HTML body (when present)

## Step 3 — Write clear, spoken‑friendly templates

Use variables to make alerts useful and concise—remember, call notifications will speak this content.

Title template example:

```
[Email Alert] {{subject}}
```

Body template example:

```
From: {{from}}
Preview: {{text}}
```

Tips:

- Want a clickable link on records? Pass `externalLink` via webhook or set a Link Template in Advanced Settings.
- Keep it short and scannable; long bodies are harder to follow when read aloud.

## Step 4 — Choose the Calling notification type

Subscribers can choose how they’re notified. For never‑miss moments, pick:

- Notification Type: Calling
- App Settings → Repeat Voice Content: On (optional)
- App Settings → Retry Failed Call: On (recommended)

Calling notifications ring like a phone call and can break through focus modes depending on your iOS settings.

## Step 5 — Filter with Conditions (optional, recommended)

Use Conditions to call only for the emails that matter. Conditions are expressions evaluated against template variables.

Examples:

- Only call for a certain sender:
  ```
  from == "alerts@yourcompany.com"
  ```
- Only call when subject contains “URGENT”:
  ```
  subject.toLowerCase().includes("urgent")
  ```
- Combine multiple rules:
  ```
  (from == "pager@service.com" || from == "vip@customer.com") && subject.toLowerCase().includes("fail")
  ```

If Conditions are empty, every email to the channel triggers a notification.

## Step 6 — Set up mail forwarding (pick your provider)

Forward the important emails to your channel address. Common options:

### Gmail

- Gmail → Settings → See all settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
- Create a filter (From / Subject contains)
- Action: Forward to your Echobell channel email address
- Optional: Add a label or skip the inbox

Note: Gmail may require verifying the forwarding address. If that’s inconvenient, forward via a group alias you control.

### iCloud Mail

- iCloud Mail → Settings → Rules
- If: From/Subject contains your conditions
- Then: Forward to your Echobell channel email address

### Outlook

- Outlook/Exchange → Settings → Mail → Rules
- Add conditions for sender/subject/keywords
- Action: Forward/Redirect to your Echobell channel email address

## Step 7 — Test your alert

- Send a test email to the channel address
- You should receive a call‑style alert that reads your templates
- Check the record in Echobell; tweak templates/conditions if needed

## Troubleshooting

- Not receiving calls:
  - Make sure your subscription’s Notification Type is set to Calling
  - Check iOS notification permissions and focus mode settings
  - Turn on “Retry Failed Call” in App Settings
- Template didn’t render:
  - Verify variable names: `from`, `to`, `subject`, `text`, `html`
  - Conditions are plain expressions—don’t wrap them in `{{ }}`
- Too noisy:
  - Tighten your Conditions
  - Add subject keywords or specific senders in your mail rules

## Where this shines

- On‑call developer alerts and production incidents
- Monitoring notifications from tools that email (and webhooks if you want both)
- Customer/VIP messages you can’t afford to miss

## Next steps

- Create separate channels for different teams or systems
- Use webhooks for automated system alerts and email for human messages
- Share the channel’s subscription link with teammates who also need calling notifications
