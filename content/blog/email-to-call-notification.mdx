# Turn important emails into call notifications

Want to make sure you never miss an urgent email again? With Echobell, you can convert important emails into call-style notifications that ring your phone like a call. It’s perfect for production incidents, VIP senders, billing failures, and other must-see alerts.

## What you'll set up

- A Channel that is triggered by email
- Templates to speak the alert title and body
- Call notifications that ring even during focus modes
- Optional Conditions to only alert for certain senders/subjects
- Mail forwarding rules from Gmail, iCloud Mail, or Outlook

## Prerequisites

- Echobell installed: App Store https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198
- Notification permission granted

## Step 1 — Create a Channel

1. Open Echobell → New Channel
2. Name and color it (e.g., "Critical Email Alerts")
3. Save

## Step 2 — Bind the email trigger

On the channel detail page, copy the dedicated email address. Any email sent to this address will trigger the channel.

When an email triggers a channel, these variables are available in templates:

- `from`: sender address
- `to`: channel-bound address
- `subject`: email subject
- `text`: plain-text body
- `html`: HTML body (when present)

## Step 3 — Write clear templates

Use variables to make the alert meaningful.

Title template example:

```
[Email Alert] {{subject}}
```

Body template example:

```
From: {{from}}
Preview: {{text}}
```

Tips:

- If you want a link in records, pass `externalLink` via webhook or set a Link Template in Advanced Settings.
- For emails, keep it concise; call alerts will speak this content.

## Step 4 — Choose the Call notification type

Subscribers can pick how they want to be notified. For never-miss alerts, choose:

- Notification Type: Call
- App Settings → Repeat Voice Content: On (optional)
- App Settings → Retry Failed Call: On (recommended)

Call notifications will ring like a call and can break through focus modes depending on your system settings.

## Step 5 — Filter with Conditions (optional but recommended)

Use Conditions to only call for specific emails. Conditions are expressions evaluated on the template variables.

Examples:

- Only call for a certain sender:
  ```
  from == "alerts@yourcompany.com"
  ```
- Only call when subject contains "URGENT":
  ```
  subject.toLowerCase().includes("urgent")
  ```
- Multiple rules:
  ```
  (from == "pager@service.com" || from == "vip@customer.com") && subject.toLowerCase().includes("fail")
  ```

If Conditions are empty, all emails to the channel will trigger notifications.

## Step 6 — Set up mail forwarding (choose your provider)

Forward the important emails to your channel’s address. Common providers:

### Gmail

- In Gmail → Settings → See all settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
- Create a filter (From / Subject contains)
- Action: Forward to your Echobell channel email address
- Optionally: Also apply a label or skip the inbox

Note: Gmail may require you to verify the forwarding address. If direct verification isn’t convenient, you can use a rule that forwards via a group alias you control.

### iCloud Mail

- iCloud Mail → Settings → Rules
- If: From/Subject contains your conditions
- Then: Forward to your Echobell channel email address

### Outlook

- Outlook/Exchange → Settings → Mail → Rules
- Add condition(s) for sender/subject/keywords
- Action: Forward/Redirect to your Echobell channel email address

## Step 7 — Test it

- Send a test email to the channel address
- You should receive a call-style alert with your templates spoken
- Check the record in Echobell; adjust templates/conditions if needed

## Troubleshooting

- Not receiving calls:
  - Ensure Notification Type is set to Call for your subscription
  - Confirm iOS notification permissions and focus mode settings
  - Turn on "Retry Failed Call" in App Settings
- Template didn’t render:
  - Check variable names: `from`, `to`, `subject`, `text`, `html`
  - Validate your expressions in Conditions (no `{{ }}` wrapper in Conditions)
- Too noisy:
  - Tighten Conditions
  - Add keywords to subjects or specific senders in your mail rules

## Privacy

Echobell stores only your account, channels, and subscriptions on the server. Email-triggered notification content and records live on your devices.

## Next steps

- Add separate channels for different teams/systems
- Combine with webhooks for system alerts and email for human messages
- Share the channel’s subscription link with teammates who also need call alerts
