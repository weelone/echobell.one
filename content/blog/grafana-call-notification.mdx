# Never Miss a Critical Alert: Setting Up Grafana Phone Call Notifications via Webhook

When monitoring critical systems, sometimes email notifications aren't enough. You need a more immediate and attention-grabbing way to be notified of critical alerts. That's where Echobell's phone call notifications come in.

## Why Phone Call Notifications?

- **Immediate Attention**: Unlike emails or push notifications that can be easily missed, phone calls are hard to ignore
- **Critical Alert Awareness**: Perfect for critical system failures that require immediate action
- **24/7 Alerting**: Ensure you never miss critical alerts, even during sleeping hours
- **Team Escalation**: Set up call cascades to multiple team members if the primary contact doesn't respond

## Setting Up Grafana Call Notifications

### Prerequisites

1. An Echobell account with an active subscription
2. Access to your Grafana instance with admin privileges
3. A configured alert rule in Grafana

### Configuration Steps

1. **Create a Webhook Contact Point**

   - In Grafana, navigate to Alerting → Contact points
   - Click "New contact point"
   - Select "Webhook" as the contact point type
   - Name it "Echobell Call Notifications"

2. **Configure the Webhook**

   - Set the URL to: `https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxxx`, the webhook from your Echobell channel.

3. **Test the Integration**

   - Use the "Test" button in Grafana to send a test notification
   - You should receive a phone call within seconds

4. **Create a Notification Policy**
   - Go to Alerting → Notification policies
   - Create a new policy or modify existing ones
   - Add the Echobell contact point to your desired alert rules

## Best Practices

- **Set Alert Thresholds Carefully**: Phone calls should be reserved for truly critical alerts
- **Configure Call Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeout periods in Echobell to prevent alert fatigue
- **Maintain Contact Lists**: Keep your emergency contact list up to date
- **Document Response Procedures**: Ensure team members know what to do when they receive a call

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize your call notifications by:

- Share your channel with team members
- Configuring retry attempts for unanswered calls
- Customizing the voice message for different types of alerts
- Setting quiet hours and backup contacts
