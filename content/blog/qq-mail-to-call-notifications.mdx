# How to Forward Important QQ Mail to Phone Call Notifications

Important QQ emails are easy to miss when you're in meetings, coding, or away from your desk. A better setup is to forward only high-priority messages to Echobell and let your phone ring with a call-style alert.

In this guide, you'll set up QQ Mail forwarding for important emails and convert them into phone call notifications in minutes.

Helpful docs before you start:

- QQ Mail setup doc: [/docs/email-to-call/qq](/docs/email-to-call/qq)
- Email trigger basics: [/docs/email-trigger](/docs/email-trigger)
- Notification types (including Calling): [/docs/notification](/docs/notification)
- Templates and variables: [/docs/template](/docs/template)
- Optional fallback conditions: [/docs/conditions](/docs/conditions)

## Why use call notifications for QQ Mail?

- Calls are much harder to ignore than normal push notifications
- You can keep daily emails quiet and only escalate critical ones
- Voice content makes alerts understandable even when you cannot look at the screen

For teams handling incidents, customer escalation, or billing risk, this setup removes most "I saw it too late" moments.

## Prerequisites

- Echobell app installed ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198))
- One Echobell channel for urgent mail alerts
- Access to QQ Mail settings

## Step 1 - Create an Echobell channel for QQ important mail

1. Open Echobell and create a new channel, for example: `QQ Critical Mail`.
2. Set Notification Type to **Calling**.
3. In app settings, enable retry options if you want stronger delivery for urgent messages.

## Step 2 - Copy the channel email and set readable templates

In your channel details, copy the channel-bound email address. This is where QQ Mail will forward important messages.

Use concise templates so call playback is clear:

Title template:

```txt
[QQ Important Mail] {{subject}}
```

Body template:

```txt
From {{from}}. {{text}}
```

You can customize variables and formatting here: [/docs/template](/docs/template)

## Step 3 - Configure QQ Mail forwarding rules

In QQ Mail, go to settings and create a rule/filter for high-priority messages:

- Match by sender (for example, boss, finance, security, key clients)
- Match by subject keywords (`urgent`, `invoice`, `failure`, `verification`)
- Action: Forward to your Echobell channel email address

When forwarding is enabled for the first time, QQ Mail sends a verification email. In Echobell, open that notification and use the top-right link to view the full email body, then click the verification link inside to activate forwarding.

This should be your primary filtering layer. For privacy, filter in QQ Mail first so only necessary emails are sent to Echobell.

Tip: Start with one strict rule first, then expand. This avoids alert fatigue on day one.

## Step 4 - Optional fallback: Echobell Conditions

Use this only as a backup layer when QQ Mail rules cannot fully express your logic.

Examples:

Only notify for finance sender:

```js
from == "billing@company.com"
```

Only notify when subject includes "urgent":

```js
subject.toLowerCase().includes("urgent")
```

Sender + keyword:

```js
(from == "security@company.com" || from == "ops@company.com") && subject.toLowerCase().includes("alert")
```

Condition reference: [/docs/conditions](/docs/conditions)

## Privacy and disclosure responsibility

When you publish this workflow for users or teams, explicitly state:

- Important filtering should be done in QQ Mail first, so only necessary messages are forwarded to Echobell.
- Users should be informed that selected email content may be forwarded for notification delivery, according to internal policy and local compliance requirements.

## Step 5 - Test end to end

1. Send a test email in QQ Mail that matches your rule.
2. Confirm QQ forwards to your channel email.
3. Confirm Echobell triggers a call notification.
4. Adjust template and filters based on the call content.

## Troubleshooting

- No call received:
  - Check subscription type is set to Calling
  - Check iOS notification permissions and focus mode behavior
- Too many calls:
  - Tighten QQ forwarding rules first
  - Add Echobell Conditions only if QQ rules are still not enough
- Voice content is too long:
  - Shorten template text and keep only key fields

## Recommended next steps

- Create separate channels by topic (finance/security/customer)
- Keep regular updates on push, reserve calls for truly urgent messages
- Review your forwarding rules monthly
