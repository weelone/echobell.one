# Never Miss a Trade Again: Get TradingView Alerts as Urgent Phone Calls with Echobell

As a trader, timing is everything. Missing a critical TradingView alert because you were away from your screen can cost you profitable opportunities or lead to significant losses. While traditional push notifications are easy to miss, phone call alerts cut through all distractions to ensure you're immediately informed when the market moves.

[Echobell](/) transforms your TradingView alerts into urgent phone call notifications that ring your device like an incoming call. This integration combines TradingView's powerful charting and alerting capabilities with Echobell's instant notification system, giving you the competitive edge you need in fast-moving markets.

## Why Phone Call Notifications for Trading?

Before diving into the setup, let's understand why phone call notifications are essential for serious traders:

- **Immediate Response**: Unlike push notifications that can be dismissed or overlooked, phone calls demand immediate attention
- **Cut Through Distractions**: Whether you're in a meeting, sleeping, or using Do Not Disturb mode, call notifications break through
- **Critical Alert Awareness**: Perfect for stop-loss triggers, breakout alerts, and time-sensitive trading opportunities
- **Multi-Device Coverage**: Receive alerts on your phone even when you're away from your trading setup

This integration is particularly valuable for day traders, swing traders, and anyone monitoring multiple instruments who can't afford to miss critical market movements.

## Prerequisites: What You Need

To set up TradingView phone call notifications with Echobell, you'll need:

- **The [Echobell app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198)**: Download and install the Echobell app on your phone. [Create your free account](/docs/what-is-echobell) if you haven't already.
- **TradingView Pro, Pro+, or Premium subscription**: TradingView's webhook functionality, which powers this integration, is available with paid subscriptions. Free accounts don't have webhook access.
- **A few minutes for setup**: The entire process takes just a few minutes to complete.

If you're new to Echobell, check out our [getting started guide](/docs/what-is-echobell) to understand how channels and notifications work.


## Step 1: Create Your Echobell Notification Channel

First, let's set up a dedicated channel in Echobell for your TradingView alerts. This channel will receive webhook notifications from TradingView and convert them into phone calls.

1. **Create a New Channel**: Open the Echobell app and tap 'Create Channel'. Give it a descriptive name like "TradingView Alerts" or "Trading Signals" and choose a color that helps you identify it quickly.

2. **Select 'Call' Notification Type**: This is crucial! When configuring your channel, select the **'Call'** notification type. This ensures that when TradingView triggers an alert, your phone will ring with an urgent call-style notification instead of a regular push notification.

3. **Customize Your Alert Templates (Optional but Recommended)**: To make your notifications more informative, customize the `Title` and `Body` [templates](/docs/template). TradingView can send dynamic data like ticker symbols, prices, and more. For example:
   - **Title template**: `{{ticker}} Alert: {{strategy.order.action}}`
   - **Body template**: `Price: ${{close}} | Volume: {{volume}}`
   
   When TradingView sends the alert data, your phone will announce something like "BTCUSD Alert: Buy - Price: $45,000 | Volume: 1.2M". Learn more about [template variables and expressions](/docs/template) in our documentation.

4. **Copy Your Webhook URL**: After creating the channel, navigate to its details and find the **Webhook** trigger URL. This unique URL is what connects TradingView to your Echobell channel. Copy this URL carefully â€“ you'll need it for the TradingView configuration.

For a deeper understanding of how Echobell channels work, check out our [TradingView integration documentation](/docs/trader/tradingview).

## Step 2: Configure TradingView Webhook Alerts

Now that your Echobell channel is ready, let's connect it to TradingView using webhooks. This allows TradingView to send instant notifications to your phone whenever your trading conditions are met.

1. **Open TradingView**: Navigate to TradingView and go to the chart you want to monitor.

2. **Create or Edit an Alert**: 
   - Click the 'Alert' clock icon in the toolbar, or right-click directly on your chart, indicator, or drawing tool
   - This opens the alert creation dialog

3. **Configure Your Alert Conditions**: Set the specific market conditions that will trigger your notification. This could be:
   - Price breaking through support/resistance levels
   - Technical indicator signals (RSI, MACD, etc.)
   - Custom strategy alerts
   - Volume thresholds

4. **Enable Webhook Notifications**:
   - In the alert dialog, find the 'Notifications' or 'Alert Actions' section
   - Check the **'Webhook URL'** option to enable webhook functionality
   - Paste your Echobell webhook URL (from Step 1) into the webhook URL field

5. **Customize the Alert Message (Recommended)**:
   The 'Message' field determines what data TradingView sends to Echobell. For the best experience, format this as JSON to pass dynamic trading data:

   ```json
   {
     "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
     "price": "{{close}}",
     "action": "BUY",
     "volume": "{{volume}}",
     "time": "{{time}}"
   }
   ```

   This JSON structure works perfectly with Echobell's [template system](/docs/template), allowing your phone call to announce specific trading details. You can also use a simple text message if you prefer.

6. **Save Your Alert**: Click 'Create' or 'Save' to activate your TradingView alert. Your webhook connection to Echobell is now live!

## Step 3: Test Your Integration

Before relying on your alerts for live trading, it's important to test the connection:

1. **Trigger a Test Alert**: Create a simple test condition that you can easily trigger, or wait for your actual alert conditions to be met.

2. **Verify the Notification**: When the alert triggers, you should receive a call-style notification on your phone within seconds. The notification will use your customized templates if you set them up in Step 1.

3. **Check Notification Permissions**: If you don't receive the call notification, ensure that Echobell has proper notification permissions on your device and that 'Call' notifications are enabled for your channel.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Not receiving notifications?**
- Verify that you copied the correct webhook URL from your Echobell channel
- Check that your TradingView subscription includes webhook functionality
- Ensure your alert conditions are properly configured in TradingView
- Confirm that Echobell has notification permissions on your device

**Notifications arriving but not as calls?**
- Make sure you selected 'Call' as the notification type when creating your channel
- Check your phone's Do Not Disturb settings - some configurations may block call-style notifications

**Want more detailed notifications?**
- Use JSON formatting in TradingView's message field to send structured data
- Customize your Echobell channel templates to display specific trading information
- Review our [template documentation](/docs/template) for advanced customization options

- **Conditional Notifications**: Use Echobell's [condition system](/docs/conditions) to filter alerts based on specific criteria
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Combine TradingView alerts with other trading tools by exploring our guides for [Grafana monitoring](/blog/grafana-call-notification) or [GitHub Actions for trading bots](/blog/github-actions-notifications)
