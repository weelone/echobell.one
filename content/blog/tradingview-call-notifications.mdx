# Never Miss a Trade Again: Get TradingView Alerts as Urgent Phone Calls with Echobell!

Tired of missing critical market moves because you weren't glued to your screen? Imagine getting an _actual phone call_ the second your crucial TradingView alert triggers! With Echobell, this isn't a dream – it's your new reality. Stop relying on easily missed notifications and start getting alerts that demand your attention.

Here’s how to bridge the gap between TradingView's signals and Echobell's powerful call alerts:

## Gear Up: What You Need

- An Echobell account with the app ready on your phone.
- A TradingView account (Heads up: TradingView's webhook magic usually requires a Pro, Pro+, or Premium subscription).

## Step 1: Forge Your Echobell Alert Channel

1.  **Summon a New Channel:** Dive into the Echobell app and hit 'Create Channel'. Give it an epic name like "TradingView GOLD Alerts" and pick a color that screams "Action!"
2.  **Unleash the 'Call' Power:** This is key! When setting up (or subscribing to) your channel, select the **'Call'** notification type. Forget subtle pings; we want a full-on call alert that cuts through the noise.
3.  **Craft Your Alert Message (Optional Ninja Move):** Want your call notification to tell you _exactly_ what's happening? Customize the `Title` and `Body` templates. TradingView can send data like the ticker symbol or price. Imagine your phone ringing and Echobell announcing, "Alert: BTC/USD just broke $50,000!" Check TradingView's docs for usable alert variables (like `{{ticker}}`, `{{close}}`) and use them in Echobell's templates like `{{variableName}}`.
4.  **Capture the Secret Weapon: Your Webhook URL:** Once your channel is forged, navigate to its details. Find the **Webhook** trigger URL – this unique link is your secret key. Copy it carefully and guard it well! TradingView will use this exact URL to instantly trigger your Echobell calls.

## Step 2: Wire Up TradingView

1.  **Enter the Arena: TradingView:** Fire up TradingView and navigate to your chosen chart.
2.  **Set Your Trap: Create/Edit the Alert:**
    - Click the 'Alert' clock icon, or right-click directly on your chart, indicator, or drawing to conjure the alert settings.
3.  **Define the Trigger:** Precisely set the market conditions that scream "Alert!" – price smashing through a resistance level, your favorite indicator flashing a signal, etc.
4.  **Connect the Wires: Configure Notifications:**
    - Hunt down the 'Notifications' or 'Alert Actions' section.
    - Find and check the box labeled **'Webhook URL'**. This activates the connection.
    - Paste your precious Echobell **Webhook Trigger URL** (from Step 1) directly into this field.
5.  **Supercharge the Message (Optional but Awesome):**
    - The 'Message' box is where you tell TradingView _what_ to shout to Echobell.
    - To make your Echobell templates shine, format this message using JSON. This lets you pass dynamic data straight from the chart to your phone call!
    - A typical JSON structure might look like this (double-check TradingView's specific variable placeholders):
      ```json
      {
        "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
        "price": "{{close}}",
        "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}"
      }
      ```
    - Even a simple message is fine, but using JSON unlocks truly informative call alerts when paired with Echobell's templates.
6.  **Arm the Alert:** Hit 'Create' or 'Save' and your TradingView alert is now locked, loaded, and ready to call you via Echobell!

## Step 3: The Moment of Truth - Test It!

Make the market trigger your alert condition (or use a test alert). Brace yourself! Your phone should ring with the distinctive Echobell call notification almost instantly. (Remember to grant Echobell notification permissions on your phone!)

**Congratulations!** You've successfully transformed passive TradingView notifications into unmissable, attention-grabbing phone calls. Trade smarter, react faster, and never let a critical market event slip by unnoticed again!
