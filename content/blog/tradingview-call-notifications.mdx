# Never miss a trade again: turn TradingView alerts into phone calls with Echobell

If you've ever watched a perfect setup slip by because you didn't see a notification in time, you're not alone. I wanted something I couldn't ignore when price hit my levels—so I turned my TradingView alerts into actual phone calls with Echobell. It takes a few minutes to wire up, and the peace of mind is worth it.

This guide shows how to connect TradingView to Echobell using a webhook, customize the voice content, and test it end to end.

Related docs if you want the big picture first:

- Notifications and priorities (Normal, Time Sensitive, Calling) → [/docs/notification](/docs/notification)
- Templates and variables → [/docs/template](/docs/template)

## Why phone call notifications for TradingView?

- Phone calls cut through focus modes and noise when seconds matter
- Echobell lets you choose priority (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling) per channel
- Templates turn raw data into a clear, human-friendly script you’ll hear on the call

Note: this article covers TradingView alerts to phone call notifications using Echobell’s webhook integration.

## Prerequisites

- Echobell app installed and an account set up ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198))
- TradingView account (webhooks typically require Pro/Pro+/Premium)

## Step 1 — Create an Echobell channel (and enable Calling)

1. Open the Echobell app → Create Channel. Name it something like “TradingView Calls” and pick a color you’ll recognize at a glance.

2. Choose the notification type. For urgent alerts, select **Calling**. For less critical alerts, you can use **Time Sensitive** or **Normal**. See [/docs/notification](/docs/notification).

3. Customize the content under Templates (optional but recommended). Your call can literally say what happened. Pair it with TradingView variables you’ll send via webhook:

   Title: `{{ticker}} crossed {{price}}`

   Body: `Signal: {{action}} at {{price}} on {{ticker}}`

   More on variables and expressions: [/docs/template](/docs/template)

4. Copy your channel’s Webhook URL from the channel details. This is the address TradingView will call. Treat it like a secret. Details: [/docs/webhook](/docs/webhook)

## Step 2 — Connect TradingView to Echobell

1. In TradingView, open your chart and create/edit an Alert.

2. Define the condition (price, indicator, strategy signal, etc.).

3. In the Notifications/Actions section, enable **Webhook URL** and paste your Echobell webhook from Step 1.

4. Craft the Message payload. Use JSON to pass dynamic values that Echobell can speak back to you via templates:

```json
{
  "ticker": "{{ticker}}",
  "price": "{{close}}",
  "action": "{{strategy.order.action}}",
  "externalLink": "https://www.tradingview.com/chart/"
}
```

Notes:

- Use TradingView’s variables (e.g., `{{ticker}}`, `{{close}}`).
- `externalLink` is optional: when included, Echobell shows a clickable link in the local record. See [/docs/notification](/docs/notification).

## Step 3 — Test the full flow

Trigger the alert (or use a test). Within seconds, you should receive an Echobell phone call with your customized content. If you prefer a less intrusive alert, try Time Sensitive first and switch to Calling for truly urgent signals.

## Troubleshooting

- No call? Make sure the channel notification type is set to Calling and the app has notification permission.
- 4xx error on the webhook in TradingView? Double‑check the exact Echobell webhook URL and that the channel token wasn’t rotated.
- Message variables not appearing? Confirm your JSON keys match your template variables exactly (case sensitive).
- Too many calls? Lower priority to Time Sensitive or refine your TradingView alert conditions.

## Make it sing with templates

Templates let you turn data into a clear script you’ll hear during the call. A few ideas:

- Add context: `{{ticker}} crossed {{price}} on 15m timeframe.`
- Include direction: `Action: {{action}}.`
- Add a link for later review with `externalLink` (shown on your local record).
