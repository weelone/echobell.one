# Turn Upptime Alerts into Instant Calls with Echobell

Upptime already monitors your sites from GitHub Actions, but the moment something breaks you still need a signal that cuts through. Echobell turns those checks into time-sensitive pushes or even phone calls—no extra servers, just a single webhook URL per channel.

## Why this pairing works

- **Real escalation**: flip a channel to call notifications for the endpoints that cannot wait.  
- **Structured context**: include site name, status, response code, and the GitHub issue link in every alert.  
- **Low-effort setup**: add two secrets in your Upptime repo and keep the rest of your config unchanged.

## Enable it in minutes

1) In Echobell, copy a channel webhook: `https://hook.echobell.one/t/<channel-token>` (choose standard, time-sensitive, or call).  
2) In your Upptime repo, add GitHub Actions secrets:

```
NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK=true
NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.echobell.one/t/<channel-token>?site=$SITE_NAME&status=$STATUS&url=$SITE_URL&issue=$ISSUE_URL&code=$RESPONSE_CODE&emoji=$EMOJI
NOTIFICATIONS_DOWN_MESSAGE=$EMOJI $SITE_NAME is $STATUS ($RESPONSE_CODE) – $ISSUE_URL
NOTIFICATIONS_UP_MESSAGE=$EMOJI $SITE_NAME is back up – $SITE_URL
```

3) In Echobell, set a simple template (`{{site}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{code}}`, `{{url}}`, `{{issue}}`) and choose whether the channel should ring your phone or stay as a push.

That’s it—Upptime delivers the data, and Echobell handles the notification style. If you need the full breakdown, the [configuration guide](/docs/developer/upptime) walks through every detail, while Upptime’s own knobs stay in the [official docs](https://upptime.js.org/docs/notifications).

## What you get

- Faster awareness when an endpoint degrades or goes down  
- Clear links back to the affected site and the GitHub issue thread  
- A reliable escalation path without touching the rest of your Upptime setup

Try it on one monitored URL, trigger a test outage, and you’ll hear (or see) the alert instantly.
