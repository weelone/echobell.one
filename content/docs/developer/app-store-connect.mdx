# App Store Connect Webhook Integration

App Store Connect provides webhook functionality to send real-time notifications about app status changes and TestFlight feedback directly to your server. By integrating App Store Connect webhooks with Echobell, you can receive instant notifications on your mobile device whenever important events occur with your iOS apps.

<Callout type="info">
  App Store Connect webhooks are available to developers with Account Holder,
  Admin, or App Manager roles. Each webhook can only apply to one app, and you
  can create up to ten webhooks per app.

3. **Configure different notification** schedules for different apps
4. **Set up role-based** channel subscriptions

## Webhook Payload Structure

App Store Connect sends webhook payloads in JSON format. Here's the typical structure:

```json
{
  "eventType": "APP_STORE_VERSION_STATE_CHANGED",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "eventId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
  "eventDate": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "app": {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "name": "My Awesome App",
      "bundleId": "com.example.myapp"
    },
    "appStoreVersion": {
      "id": "987654321",
      "versionString": "1.2.0",
      "appStoreState": "READY_FOR_SALE"
    }
  }
}
```
