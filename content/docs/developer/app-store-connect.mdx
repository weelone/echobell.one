# App Store Connect Webhook Integration

App Store Connect provides webhook functionality to send real-time notifications about app status changes and TestFlight feedback directly to your server. By integrating App Store Connect webhooks with Echobell, you can receive instant notifications on your mobile device whenever important events occur with your iOS apps.

<Callout type="info">
  App Store Connect webhooks are available to developers with Account Holder,
  Admin, or App Manager roles. Each webhook can only apply to one app, and you
  can create up to ten webhooks per app.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell account with at least one channel created
- Access to App Store Connect with Account Holder, Admin, or App Manager role

3. Choose a distinctive color for easy identification
4. Add team members who should receive app status notifications

### 2. Configure Notification Templates

Set up templates that will format your App Store Connect events effectively:

**Title Template:**

```
[{{app.name}}] {{eventType}} - {{status}}
```

**Body Template:**

```
📱 App: {{app.name}}
🔄 Event: {{eventType}}
📊 Status: {{status}}
⏰ Time: {{eventDate}}

🔗 View in App Store Connect
```

### 3. Get Your Echobell Webhook URL

1. In your Echobell channel settings, navigate to the **Triggers** section
2. Copy the webhook URL provided
3. Keep this URL secure as it will be configured in App Store Connect

### 4. Configure App Store Connect Webhook

According to [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-team/manage-webhooks/), follow these steps:

#### Create a Webhook

1. Sign in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to **Users and Access**
3. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar
4. Under **Additional**, click **Webhooks**
5. Click the add button (+) next to Webhooks
6. Configure your webhook:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Echobell Notifications")
   - **Payload URL**: Paste your Echobell webhook URL
   - **Secret**: Create a secure secret string for authentication
   - **App**: Select the app you want to monitor
   - **Event Triggers**: Select the events you want to receive notifications for

#### Available Event Triggers

Select from these event types based on your monitoring needs:

**App Version Events:**

- **App Store Version State Changed**: When your app's review status changes
- **App Store Version Released**: When your app version is released to the App Store

**TestFlight Events:**

- **TestFlight Beta Feedback**: When beta testers submit feedback

2. You should receive a test notification in Echobell with event type "Ping"

## Advanced Configuration

### Webhook Security

To enhance security and verify webhook authenticity:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Echobell webhook URLs use HTTPS by default
2. **Secret handling**: App Store Connect requires a secret, but Echobell doesn't currently validate it automatically. Keep the value so you can verify payloads manually if needed.
3. **IP Allowlisting**: Consider allowlisting Apple's webhook delivery IP ranges

### Custom Notification Templates

Customize your templates based on different event types:

**For App Status Changes:**

- Title Template:

```
[{{app.name}}] App {{eventType}}
```

- Body Template:

```
🍎 Your app "{{app.name}}" status has changed!

📊 Status: {{status}}
📅 Date: {{eventDate}}
```

- Link Template:

```
{{app.url}}
```

**For TestFlight Feedback:**

- Title Template:

```
[{{app.name}}] New TestFlight Feedback
```

- Body Template:

```
📱 App: {{app.name}}
👤 Tester: {{tester.name}}
⭐ Rating: {{rating}}/5
💬 Feedback: {{feedback}}
📱 Device: {{device}}
```

- Link Template:

```
{{feedbackUrl}}
```

### Managing Multiple Apps

For teams managing multiple apps:

1. **Create separate channels** for each app or app category
2. **Use descriptive naming** conventions (e.g., "MyApp - Production", "MyApp - Beta")
3. **Configure different notification** schedules for different apps
4. **Set up role-based** channel subscriptions

## Webhook Payload Structure

App Store Connect sends webhook payloads in JSON format. Here's the typical structure:

```json
{
  "eventType": "APP_STORE_VERSION_STATE_CHANGED",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "eventId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
  "eventDate": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "app": {
      "id": "1234567890",
      "name": "My Awesome App",
      "bundleId": "com.example.myapp"
    },
    "appStoreVersion": {
      "id": "987654321",
      "versionString": "1.2.0",
      "appStoreState": "READY_FOR_SALE"
    }
  }
}
```
