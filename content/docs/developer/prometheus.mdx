# Prometheus Integration

Prometheus with Alertmanager is a widely used open-source monitoring and alerting stack. By integrating Alertmanager with Echobell, you can receive instant mobile notifications (including time-sensitive or call-style alerts) whenever your alert rules fire.

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell account with at least one channel created
- A running Prometheus + Alertmanager setup
- Access to edit your Alertmanager configuration (alertmanager.yml)

## Setup Overview

1. Create an Echobell channel
2. Configure notification templates (and optional Link Template)
3. Choose an integration method:
   - Webhook via Alertmanager webhook receiver (recommended)
   - Email via Alertmanager email receiver (alternative)
4. Create or update alert rules
5. Test and refine

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1) Create an Echobell Channel

1. Open the Echobell app
2. Create a new channel (e.g., "Prometheus Alerts")
3. Pick a color for easy identification

### 2) Configure Notification Templates

Alertmanager‚Äôs webhook payload contains structured fields like status, commonLabels, commonAnnotations, externalURL and an alerts array. You can reference these fields directly in Echobell templates.

Suggested templates:

Title template:

```
{{commonLabels.alertname}} - {{status}}
```

Body template:

```
üîî Alert: {{commonLabels.alertname}}
üìä Severity: {{commonLabels.severity}}
üñ•Ô∏è Instance: {{alerts[0].labels["instance"]}}
‚è∞ Starts: {{alerts[0].startsAt}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è Summary: {{commonAnnotations.summary}}
üßæ Description: {{commonAnnotations.description}}
```

Optional Link Template (Advanced Settings):

```
{{alerts[0].generatorURL || externalURL}}
```

This shows a direct link to the firing graph or dashboard inside your alert record. If generatorURL isn‚Äôt present, it falls back to externalURL.

### 3) Integration Method A ‚Äî Webhook (Recommended)

1. In your Echobell channel, copy the Webhook URL from Triggers
2. In Alertmanager, add a webhook receiver that posts to that URL

Minimal alertmanager.yml example:

```yaml
route:
  receiver: echobell-webhook

receivers:
  - name: echobell-webhook
    webhook_configs:
      - url: "https://hook.echobell.one/t/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN"
        send_resolved: true
        http_config:
          follow_redirects: true
```

Notes:

- send_resolved: true will also notify when alerts resolve (status becomes resolved)
- Echobell reads the JSON body as-is, so the templates above will render correctly

### 3 alt) Integration Method B ‚Äî Email (Alternative)

If you prefer or require email, use Alertmanager‚Äôs email receiver and send to the channel‚Äôs bound email address.

1. In Echobell, copy the channel‚Äôs email address from the Triggers section
2. Configure an email receiver in Alertmanager and use simple templates

Example snippet:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: echobell-email
    email_configs:
      - to: "PASTE_CHANNEL_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
        send_resolved: true
        subject: "{{ .CommonLabels.alertname }} - {{ .Status }}"
        html: |
          <p><strong>Summary:</strong> {{ .CommonAnnotations.summary }}</p>
          <p>{{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}</p>
          <p>
            <a href='{{ (index .Alerts 0).GeneratorURL }}' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Open in Prometheus</a>
          </p>
```

In Echobell templates for email triggers, you can use variables like subject, text, and html that Echobell provides automatically.

### 4) Create an Example Alert Rule

Here‚Äôs a small example rule to test the flow:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPU
        expr: avg(rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])) > 0.8
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage"
          description: "CPU has been over 80% for 2 minutes"
```

Once this alert fires, Alertmanager will send the event to your configured receiver and Echobell will notify subscribers to the channel.

## Testing the Integration

1. Temporarily lower thresholds or create a test alert that fires quickly
2. Confirm you receive an Echobell notification when it fires
3. If using the Link Template, open the record and tap the link
4. Resolve the alert and verify you receive the resolution notification (if enabled)

## Choosing Notification Types

- Time Sensitive: critical production outages, paging-level incidents
- Calling: severe outages where you must wake or interrupt focus modes
- Normal: routine alerts, warnings, or informational notices

## Best Practices

1. Keep templates concise but informative (alert name, severity, instance, summary)
2. Use the Link Template to jump straight to the relevant graph or dashboard
3. Group and route alerts in Alertmanager to avoid noise and fatigue
4. Include severity labels and use Echobell notification types to match urgency
5. Protect your Echobell webhook URL like a secret; rotate if exposed

## Troubleshooting

If alerts aren‚Äôt appearing in Echobell:

- Verify the correct webhook URL or channel email address
- Ensure the Echobell channel is active and has subscribers
- Check Alertmanager logs for delivery errors
- Confirm your route in alertmanager.yml actually points to the intended receiver
- Test with a simple one-off alert rule
- If using email, ensure your SMTP settings work and emails are being delivered

## Privacy and Data Handling

Echobell is privacy-first:

- Notification content stays on your devices
- Only minimal configuration data is stored on servers
- Webhook URLs and channel email addresses should be treated as secrets
- Echobell does not retain your alert payloads on its servers
