# Upptime Integration

You can forward Upptime's outage and recovery events directly into Echobell, so your team gets time-sensitive push alerts or phone calls without building a separate pipeline. This guide focuses on the Echobell side of the setup and uses Upptime's native notification variables. For any Upptime-specific options, refer to the [official notification docs](https://upptime.js.org/docs/notifications).

## Why use Echobell for Upptime alerts

- Phone-call escalation for critical outages while keeping routine checks as standard or time-sensitive pushes
- Templates and variables so every alert shows the affected site, status, response code, and GitHub issue link
- No extra infrastructure—just a secure webhook URL per Echobell channel

## Prerequisites

- An existing Upptime repository with GitHub Actions enabled
- Permission to add GitHub repository secrets
- An Echobell channel with a webhook URL (in the app, open the channel → copy its webhook URL)

<Steps>
<Step>
### Prepare an Echobell channel

1. Create or open a channel in Echobell and choose the notification style you prefer (standard, time-sensitive, or call).
2. Copy the channel webhook URL; it looks like `https://hook.echobell.one/t/<channel-token>`.
3. (Optional) Set a template that uses variables such as `{{site}}`, `{{status}}`, `{{code}}`, `{{url}}`, and `{{issue}}` so your alerts stay structured.
</Step>
<Step>

### Add Upptime secrets for Echobell

In your Upptime repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

- `NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK=true`
- `NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hook.echobell.one/t/<channel-token>?site=$SITE_NAME&status=$STATUS&url=$SITE_URL&issue=$ISSUE_URL&code=$RESPONSE_CODE&emoji=$EMOJI`
- (Optional) `NOTIFICATIONS_DOWN_MESSAGE=$EMOJI $SITE_NAME is $STATUS ($RESPONSE_CODE) – $ISSUE_URL`
- (Optional) `NOTIFICATIONS_UP_MESSAGE=$EMOJI $SITE_NAME is back up – $SITE_URL`

Notes:

- The query parameters carry structured data into Echobell. Upptime appends the variables, and Echobell stores them as template variables (`site`, `status`, `url`, `issue`, `code`, `emoji`).
- Keep the URL encoded (replace spaces with `%20` if you customize text) to avoid breaking the request.
- Other notification providers or strategies stay managed in Upptime—only add what you need for Echobell and keep the rest in the GitHub secrets UI.
</Step>
<Step>

### Map variables in Echobell

Use a concise template so alerts remain readable:

```
Title: {{emoji}} Upptime: {{site}} is {{status}}
Body: Response {{code}} · {{url}}
External link: {{issue}}
```

You can switch the channel's notification style to "Time-Sensitive" or "Call" for high-priority sites while keeping others as standard pushes.

</Step>
<Step>
### Test the integration

- Temporarily point a monitored URL to a non-existent endpoint or pause a service to trigger a failure.
- Confirm the alert arrives in Echobell with your template fields populated.
- Restore the service and verify the recovery message.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure `NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK` and `NOTIFICATION_CUSTOM_WEBHOOK_URL` are spelled exactly as in the secrets list.
- If you change the Echobell channel token, update the secret.
- For any Upptime-side failures or additional providers, check the [official docs](https://upptime.js.org/docs/notifications) and your GitHub Actions logs.
