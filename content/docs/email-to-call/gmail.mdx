# Convert Gmail Emails to Phone Calls

Follow this guide to set up a filter in Gmail that automatically forwards specific emails to Echobell, triggering a phone call to your device.

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell channel with **Email Trigger** enabled.
- The unique email address for your channel (found in Channel Settings).

## Step 1: Add Forwarding Address

1.  Open **Gmail** on your computer.
2.  Click the **Settings gear icon** (⚙️) and select **See all settings**.
3.  Go to the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab.
4.  Click **Add a forwarding address**.
5.  Enter your Echobell channel email address (e.g., `ch_... @trigger.echobell.one`) and click **Next**.
6.  **Verification:** Gmail will send a verification code to this address.
    - Open the Echobell app.
    - Go to your Channel's **Records** tab.
    - Find the email from Gmail Team.
    - Click the link in the email body or copy the confirmation code.
7.  Go back to Gmail settings, enter the code, and click **Verify**.

## Step 2: Create a Filter

Do **not** enable "Forward a copy of incoming mail to" in the general settings, as this will forward *all* your emails. Instead, use a filter:

1.  Click the **Show search options** icon (filters icon) in the Gmail search bar.
2.  Define criteria for the emails you want to trigger a call (e.g., From: `alerts@example.com`, Subject: `Critical`).
3.  Click **Create filter**.
4.  Check the box **Forward it to:** and select your Echobell channel address.
5.  (Optional) You can also check "Mark as read" or "Archive it" if you don't want these in your inbox.
6.  Click **Create filter**.

## Step 3: Test It

Send an email that matches your filter criteria to your Gmail address. Your phone should ring via Echobell instantly.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure your Echobell notification setting for this channel is set to **Calling** mode to receive actual phone calls.
