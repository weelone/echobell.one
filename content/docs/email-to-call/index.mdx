# Email to Call

Turn critical emails into phone calls instantly. By setting up auto-forwarding rules in your email provider, you can trigger Echobell to call your phone whenever you receive an urgent email.

## Why Convert Email to Call?

- **Never Miss Alerts:** Emails can be easily missed or ignored. A phone call is hard to ignore.
- **Urgent Notifications:** Perfect for server downtime alerts, security warnings, or critical business updates.
- **No Coding Required:** Use your email provider's built-in forwarding rules.

## How It Works

1.  **Get Your Channel Email:** In your Echobell channel settings, copy the unique **Email Trigger** address (e.g., `ch_... @trigger.echobell.one`).
2.  **Set Up Forwarding:** Configure your email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, QQ, etc.) to auto-forward specific emails to your Echobell channel address.
3.  **Receive Calls:** When a matching email arrives, it is forwarded to Echobell, which instantly calls your phone.
