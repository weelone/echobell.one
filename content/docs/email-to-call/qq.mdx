# Convert QQ Emails to Phone Calls

Use QQ Mail's receive rules to forward specific emails to Echobell and receive them as phone calls.

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell channel with **Email Trigger** enabled.
- Your Echobell channel email address.

## Step 1: Set Up Forwarding Rule

1.  Log in to **QQ Mail** on the web.
2.  Click **Settings** (设置) at the top.
3.  Go to the **Receive Rules** (收信规则) tab.
4.  Click **Create Rule** (创建收信规则).
5.  **Enable** the rule.
6.  **Conditions:** Set the conditions for emails you want to trigger calls (e.g., Subject includes "Error").
7.  **Action:** Check **Forward to** (自动转发给).
8.  Enter your Echobell channel email address.
    - You may be asked to verify this address. QQ Mail usually sends a verification email.
    - Check your Echobell **Records** for this email and click the confirmation link.
9.  Click **Submit** (立即创建).

## Step 2: Verify

If you haven't already, ensure the forwarding address is verified. QQ Mail might require you to confirm the forwarding setup in the settings page after clicking the link in the email.

## Step 3: Test

Send a test email matching your rule to your QQ Mail address. Ensure your Echobell channel is set to **Calling** mode to hear the ring.

  QQ Mail might require you to enable SMTP/POP3 services or set an independent password for third-party access, but for simple forwarding rules, this is usually not required.
