# Convert Yahoo Emails to Phone Calls

Learn how to use Yahoo Mail filters to automatically forward important emails to Echobell, turning them into instant phone calls.

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell channel with **Email Trigger** enabled.
- Your Echobell channel email address.

## Step 1: Verify Forwarding Address

1.  Log in to **Yahoo Mail** on the web.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **More Settings**.
3.  Select **Mailboxes**.
4.  Under "Forwarding", you may need to add and verify your Echobell address.
    - *Note: Yahoo sometimes restricts forwarding to paid accounts. If direct forwarding is not available, check if Filters allow it (see below).*
5.  If verification is required, check your Echobell **Records** for the verification email from Yahoo.

## Step 2: Create a Filter

1.  Go to **Settings** > **More Settings**.
2.  Select **Filters**.
3.  Click **Add new filters**.
4.  Name your filter (e.g., "Critical Alerts").
5.  Set the rules for the emails you want to capture (e.g., From contains `admin@myserver.com`).
6.  Under **Choose a destination folder or forward**, select **Forward to** (if available).
7.  Enter your Echobell channel email address.
8.  Click **Save**.
