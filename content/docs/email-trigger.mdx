# Email Triggers

Email triggers provide a simple way to send notifications through Echobell without requiring any programming knowledge. Each channel can have a dedicated email address, and when an email is sent to this address, it automatically triggers notifications to all subscribers of that channel.

## How Email Triggers Work

When you set up an email trigger for a channel:

1. A unique email address is assigned to your channel
2. Any email sent to this address will trigger the channel
3. The email's content is automatically parsed into variables
4. These variables can be used in your notification templates

## Available Email Variables

When an email triggers your channel, Echobell automatically extracts the following variables that you can use in your notification templates:

- `from`: The sender's email address
- `to`: The recipient's email address (your channel's email address)
- `subject`: The subject line of the email
- `text`: The plain text content of the email
- `html`: The HTML content of the email (if available)

## System Time Variables (UTC)

Beyond email fields, read‑only system time variables are always available in templates and conditions (UTC): `date`, `time`, `year`, `month`, `dayOfWeek`/`dayOfWeekName`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `epochMs`, `epochSeconds`, and more. See [Conditions](/docs/conditions) for the complete list and usage examples.

## Using Email Variables in Templates

You can use these variables in your notification templates using the `{{variableName}}` syntax. For example:

```
Title template: New email from {{from}}
Body template: Subject: {{subject}}

{{text}}
```

## Use Cases

Email triggers are particularly useful for:

- Forwarding important emails as notifications
- Creating notification workflows without coding
- Integrating with legacy systems that support email but not webhooks
- Setting up alerts from email-based monitoring systems
- Converting email newsletters into mobile notifications

<Callout type="info">
  If the email sender needs to verify the address before triggering
  notifications, you can find a link in the verification email records. Open the
  link to check the email content and verify the email address.

## Privacy and Data Storage

Like all features in Echobell:

- Only channel configuration data is stored on our servers
- The content of notifications and email triggers is stored locally on your device
- Your email data never leaves your control

## Best Practices

1. Use clear and specific email addresses for different channels
2. Set up appropriate notification templates that match your email content
3. Consider using Time Sensitive or Calling notification types for urgent emails
4. Test your email trigger setup with a sample email before relying on it

## Setting Up Email Triggers

1. Create or select a channel in Echobell
2. Navigate to the channel settings
3. Find the Email Trigger section
4. Copy the provided email address
5. Use this email address wherever you want to trigger notifications

<Callout type="warn">
  Keep your channel's email address private to prevent unauthorized triggers.
