## Core Features

### Notification Channels

At the heart of Echobell are channels - customizable notification pipelines that you can create for different purposes. Each channel has:

- A unique name and color for easy identification
- Customizable notification templates
- Flexible triggering options (webhook or email)
- Shareable subscription links

### Triggering Methods

#### Webhook Triggers

Integrate with virtually any system using webhook URLs. When these URLs are called, your channel sends notifications to all subscribers. Perfect for:

- Server monitoring alerts
- CI/CD pipeline notifications
- IoT device status updates
- E-commerce order notifications

You can provide variables through query parameters or JSON body:

```http
GET https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxx?server_name=Production&cpu_usage=95

# OR

POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxx
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "server_name": "Production",
  "cpu_usage": 95
}
```

Special Variables:

- `externalLink`: When included, creates a clickable link in the notification records

#### Email Triggers

Each channel can have a dedicated email address. When an email is sent to this address, the channel is triggered. This enables:

- Forward important emails as notifications
- Create notification flows without coding
- Integrate with legacy systems that support email but not webhooks

Available email variables:

- `from`: Sender's email address
- `subject`: Email subject line
- `text`: Plain text content
- `html`: HTML content

### Notification Types

Subscribers can choose from three notification types based on urgency:

1. **Normal**

   - Standard app notifications for routine alerts
   - Follows your device's normal notification settings

2. **Time Sensitive**

   - High-priority notifications
   - Can break through certain focus modes
   - Use for important alerts that shouldn't be missed

3. **Calling**
   - Call-like alerts for critical situations
   - Demands immediate attention
   - Appears as incoming calls on your device

### Template System

Make your notifications dynamic using customizable templates with variables:

- **Title Template**: Determines what appears in the notification header
- **Body Template**: Controls the main content of the notification

Example template:

```
Title: Server {{server_name}} is down!
Body: CPU usage reached {{cpu_usage}}%
```

Variables are enclosed in double curly braces `{{variableName}}` and are populated from trigger data.

### Privacy Features

Echobell is built with privacy at its core:

- Only user accounts, channels, and subscription data stored on servers
- Notification content and history stay exclusively on your device
- Your sensitive alert data never leaves your control

### App Settings

Customize how notifications behave:

- **Repeat Voice Content**: For call notifications, enables repeating the notification content
- **Retry Failed Call**: Automatically retries call notifications that failed due to Focus Mode
