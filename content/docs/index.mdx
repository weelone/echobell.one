# Get Started with Echobell

We've all been there - that sinking feeling when you realize your server has been down for hours, or your CI/CD pipeline failed while you were grabbing coffee. The endless stream of notifications from different tools has made us numb to alerts, causing us to miss the ones that actually matter.

That's exactly why we built Echobell. After years of being woken up by false alarms or missing critical alerts entirely, we knew there had to be a better way to handle instant notifications.

## What Makes Echobell Different?

Echobell transforms how you manage alerts and notifications by focusing on what developers actually need:

- **Smart webhook notifications** that trigger only when it matters
- **Email-to-notification** bridges for legacy systems
- **Customizable alert channels** that you control completely
- **Privacy-first design** - your notification data stays on your device

Think of it as your personal notification butler - intelligent enough to know when to disturb you and when to stay quiet.

## Understanding Echobell's Core Concepts

Let's break down how Echobell works in terms that make sense for your daily workflow:

### Channels - Your Notification Command Centers

Think of a **Channel** as a dedicated notification pipeline for different aspects of your system:

- Each channel has a distinct **name and color** (because visual recognition saves precious seconds during emergencies)
- **Notification templates** define exactly what information gets sent to your phone
- Channels can be triggered via webhooks or good old-fashioned email
- Share channels with your team or subscribe to channels others create

*Real example: You might have a "Production Alerts" channel (red) for critical system issues and a "Deploy Updates" channel (green) for successful deployments.*

### Triggers - How Your Systems Talk to You

A **Trigger** is simply how your systems wake up your channel:

- **Webhook URL**: Your monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, or any system can call this URL to send you instant notifications
- **Email Address**: Forward important emails or integrate with systems that only know how to send email

*Why both? Sometimes you're dealing with a modern microservice that speaks REST APIs, other times you're working with that legacy system from 2015 that only knows SMTP.*

### Notification Types - Matching Urgency to Reality

When you subscribe to a channel, you choose how urgently you want to be interrupted:

- **Normal**: Standard push notifications for routine updates
- **Time Sensitive**: Breaks through Do Not Disturb for important but not critical alerts  
- **Calling**: Phone call alerts for "wake-me-up-at-3am" level emergencies

*Pro tip: Reserve calling notifications for true emergencies. Nothing breaks trust like false alarm calls.*

## Getting Started - Your First 5 Minutes with Echobell

Let's get you set up with your first notification channel. I promise it's easier than configuring Prometheus alerts!

### 1. Download and Set Up Your Account

1. **Download Echobell** from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198) (yes, it's free)
2. **Sign in** with your email or Apple ID - whatever feels more comfortable

*Quick note: We use your email only for account management. No spam, no newsletters unless you explicitly ask for them.*

### 2. Create Your First Notification Channel

Here's where the magic happens:

1. **Tap the bottom-right button** to navigate to the **Channels** view
2. **Tap the + button** - time to create your first channel
3. **Name your channel** meaningfully (e.g., "Production Server Alerts" or "CI/CD Pipeline")
4. **Pick a color** that makes sense to you (red for critical, green for success, etc.)
5. **Set up notification templates** (we'll explain this in detail below)
6. **Choose whether to auto-subscribe** yourself to this channel
7. **Select your notification urgency level** (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling)
8. **Save** and celebrate - you've just created your first smart notification channel!

*Tip: Start with a test channel first. Name it something like "Test Alerts" so you can experiment without accidentally sending critical alerts to your entire team.*

### 3. Connect Your Systems with Triggers

This is where Echobell becomes truly powerful. **Tap your newly created channel** to access its settings page - this is your notification control center.

#### Option A: Webhook Triggers (The Modern Way)

Perfect for modern systems, monitoring tools, and anything that can make HTTP requests:

1. **Tap the webhook button** to copy your unique webhook URL
2. **Integrate this URL** into your systems:
   - Grafana alerts
   - GitHub Actions workflows  
   - Kubernetes monitoring
   - Custom scripts and monitoring tools
   - Any system that can make HTTP calls

Here's how easy it is to trigger notifications:

```bash
# Simple GET request with alert data
curl "https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id?server=web-01&status=DOWN&cpu=95%"

# Or POST with JSON (for complex data)
curl -X POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "server": "web-01",
    "status": "CRITICAL", 
    "message": "CPU usage spiked to 95%",
    "dashboard_url": "https://grafana.company.com/dashboard/123"
  }'
```

**Pro tip:** Include an `externalLink` variable in your webhook calls. It becomes a clickable link in your notification, perfect for jumping straight to dashboards or logs.

#### Option B: Email Triggers (The Universal Fallback)

Sometimes you need to work with systems that predate REST APIs:

1. **Tap the email button** to reveal your channel's unique email address
2. **Forward important emails** to this address, or configure legacy systems to send alerts here
3. When emails arrive, they automatically trigger notifications with these variables:
   - `from` - who sent the email
   - `subject` - the email subject line  
   - `text` - plain text email content
   - `html` - formatted email content

*This is incredibly useful for integrating with older systems, forwarding critical emails, or creating notification workflows without writing code.*

### 4. Craft Perfect Notification Messages

This is where you transform raw data into actionable alerts. Good notification templates are the difference between useful alerts and notification spam.

**Template Basics:**
1. **Navigate to Notification Templates** in your channel settings
2. **Title template** - Keep it concise but informative (this shows in your notification preview)
3. **Body template** - Include the details you need to take action
4. **Use variables** enclosed in `{{double_braces}}` to make templates dynamic

**Real-world examples that work:**

```
Title: ðŸš¨ {{server}} is having issues
Body: Status: {{status}} | CPU: {{cpu}}% | Memory: {{memory}}% | Check: {{dashboard_url}}
```

```  
Title: âœ… Deploy completed to {{environment}}
Body: {{app_name}} v{{version}} deployed successfully. Duration: {{deploy_time}}
```

```
Title: ðŸ’¸ New order #{{order_id}} 
Body: Customer: {{customer_name}} | Amount: ${{amount}} | Items: {{item_count}}
```

**Template Pro Tips:**
- Start with emojis or status indicators for quick visual recognition
- Include actionable information (URLs, server names, error codes)
- Keep titles under 50 characters for better mobile display
- Test your templates with real data before going live

### 5. Share Channels and Build Your Notification Network

One of Echobell's most powerful features is collaborative notifications:

**To subscribe to someone else's channel:**
1. **Tap Subscribe** in the channels view
2. **Paste the subscription link** they shared with you
3. **Choose your notification urgency level** (you control this, not the channel owner)
4. **Confirm** - you'll now receive their notifications

**To share your channels:**
1. **Open your channel settings**  
2. **Copy the subscription link**
3. **Share it** with team members via Slack, email, or however your team communicates

*This is fantastic for team alerts, deployment notifications, or sharing monitoring data across departments.*

## Fine-Tuning Your Notification Experience

### App Settings That Actually Matter

Access these through the app settings to customize your Echobell experience:

- **Repeat Voice Content**: When you get calling notifications, this makes the message repeat so you catch every detail (useful when woken up at 3 AM)
- **Retry Failed Call**: Automatically retries calling notifications that fail due to Do Not Disturb or other focus modes

*Small settings, big impact on reliability.*

## Your Privacy Comes First

We built Echobell with a privacy-first mindset because we're developers too and we know how sensitive system data can be:

- **Server-side data**: Only your account, channel definitions, and subscription lists  
- **Device-only data**: All notification content and history stays completely local
- **Your control**: Your alert data never leaves your control or gets analyzed by us

*Translation: We see that you created a channel called "Production Alerts" but we never see the actual alert content like "Database CPU at 95%".*

## What's Next? Level Up Your Alert Game

Now that you have your first channel running, here are some ways to evolve your notification setup:

**Immediate next steps:**
- Create channels for different severity levels (Info, Warning, Critical)
- Set up webhook integrations with your existing monitoring tools
- Share important channels with your team members

**Advanced strategies:**
- Use conditional templates to customize messages based on alert data
- Create escalation workflows with different notification types
- Build channel hierarchies for complex systems

**Integration ideas:**
- Connect your CI/CD pipeline for deployment notifications
- Bridge legacy email alerts into modern push notifications  
- Set up monitoring dashboards that speak directly to your phone
