# Get Started with Echobell

Welcome to Echobell, the instant alert app that helps you stay on top of important notifications. This guide will walk you through setting up and using Echobell effectively.

## What is Echobell?

Echobell is a powerful notification management tool that:

- Handles webhooks and emails as triggers
- Sends customized notifications to subscribers
- Allows you to create and share notification channels
- Keeps your notification data private on your device

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, let's understand some key concepts:

### Channels

A **Channel** is the core unit in Echobell for organizing and distributing notifications:

- Each channel has a unique **Name** and **Color** for easy identification
- Channels contain **Notification Templates** that determine what information is sent
- Channels are triggered through webhooks or emails
- You can create your own channels or subscribe to others

### Triggers

A **Trigger** is what activates a channel to send notifications:

- **Webhook**: A URL endpoint that, when called, activates the channel
- **Email**: An email address linked to the channel that, when messaged, activates the channel

### Notification Types

When subscribing to a channel, you can choose from different notification styles:

- **Normal**: Standard app notification
- **Time Sensitive**: High-priority notification that can break through focus modes
- **Calling**: Call-like alert for the most urgent matters

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Your Account

1. Download Echobell from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198)
2. Open the app and sign in with your email or sign in with Apple

### 2. Creating Your First Channel

1. From the main view, tap the button on the bottom right corner to navigate to the **Channels** view
2. Tap the **+** button to create a new channel
3. Enter a name for your channel (e.g., "Server Alerts")
4. Select a color to identify your channel
5. Configure your notification templates:
   - **Title template**: What appears as the notification headline
   - **Body template**: The detailed content of the notification
6. Optionally, toggle whether to subscribe the channel to yourself
7. Choose a **Notification Type** for your channel (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling)
8. Save your new channel

### 3. Setting Up a Trigger

Once your channel is created, there are two ways to trigger notifications: via webhooks or emails. Tap the channel you just created to access its settings. In the channel settings, you can find the **Triggers** section.

#### Webhook Trigger

1. Tap the **webhook** button to copy the generated webhook URL
2. Integrate this URL into your systems (e.g., server monitoring, CI/CD pipeline)
3. When the URL is called, your channel will be triggered

You can provide variables to your notification templates in two ways:

```bash
# Example webhook call with query parameters
curl -X GET "https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id?server=production&status=critical&message=CPU%20usage%20at%2095%25"

# OR with JSON body
curl -X POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"server": "production", "status": "critical", "message": "CPU usage at 95%"}'
```

These variables will be used to populate your notification templates. For example, if your title template is `{{server}} - {{status}}`, it would render as "production - critical".

**Special Variables:**

- `externalLink`: If you include this variable, it will be displayed as a clickable link in the notification records

#### Email Trigger

1. Tap the **email** button to copy the generated email address for your channel
2. When an email is sent to this address, your channel will be triggered

With email triggers, Echobell automatically extracts these variables from the email:

- `from`: The sender's email address
- `to`: The recipient's email address (your channel's email)
- `subject`: The email subject line
- `text`: The plain text content of the email
- `html`: The HTML content of the email

You can use these variables in your templates, such as `{{subject}}` or `{{text}}`.

### 4. Customizing Notification Templates

Templates use variables that are filled from the trigger data:

1. In your channel settings, go to **Notification Templates**
2. For the title template, you might use: `{{server}} - {{status}}`
3. For the body template, you could use: `{{message}} Detected at {{timestamp}}`
4. Variables are enclosed in double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`
5. Test your template with sample data

### 5. Subscribing to Channels

1. You can share the subscription link of your channels to others
2. Or you can use subscription links shared by others to subscribe to the channels
3. Tap **Subscribe** on the channels view
4. Enter the subscription link
5. Choose your preferred **Notification Type**:
   - Normal for standard alerts
   - Time Sensitive for important alerts
   - Calling for critical situations
6. Confirm your subscription

## App Settings

You can customize how Echobell handles notifications through these settings:

- **Repeat Voice Content**: When using call notifications, this setting will make the notification content repeat
- **Retry Failed Call**: Automatically retry call notifications that failed due to Focus Mode or other reasons

## Privacy and Data Storage

Echobell prioritizes your privacy:

- Only user accounts, channels, and subscription data are stored on our servers
- Notification content and history are stored locally on your device
- Your alert data never leaves your control

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up your first channel:

- Explore advanced template options
- Share your channels with team members
