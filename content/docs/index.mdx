# Get Started with Echobell

Welcome to Echobell, the instant alert app that helps you stay on top of important notifications. Whether you're a developer needing webhook alerts for your CI/CD pipeline, a system administrator monitoring servers, or a team managing critical notifications, this comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up and using Echobell effectively.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to create notification channels, set up webhook and email triggers, customize notification templates, and integrate Echobell with your existing tools and workflows.

## What is Echobell?

Echobell is a powerful notification management tool designed for developers, DevOps teams, and anyone who needs reliable instant alerts. It bridges the gap between your systems and your mobile device, ensuring critical information reaches you immediately.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Webhook Integration**: Connect any system that can make HTTP requests - monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, IoT devices, and more
- **Email Triggers**: Turn any email into an instant notification by forwarding to your channel's dedicated email address
- **Custom Templates**: Use dynamic variables to create informative, context-rich notifications
- **Flexible Notification Types**: Choose between normal notifications, time-sensitive alerts, or phone call-style notifications for critical issues
- **Privacy-First Design**: Your notification history stays on your device, not on our servers
- **Team Collaboration**: Share channels with teammates and manage subscriber access

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, let's understand some key concepts:

### Channels

A **Channel** is the core unit in Echobell for organizing and distributing notifications:

- Each channel has a unique **Name** and **Color** for easy identification across different alert sources
- Channels contain **[Notification Templates](/docs/template)** that determine what information is sent to subscribers
- Channels are triggered through **[webhooks](/docs/webhook)** or **[emails](/docs/email-trigger)**
- You can create your own channels or subscribe to channels shared by others
- Each channel supports **[conditions](/docs/conditions)** to filter which triggers actually send notifications
- Channels can be shared via secure subscription links with team members or the public

Think of a channel as a notification pipeline: data comes in through triggers, gets formatted by templates, filtered by conditions, and delivered as notifications to all subscribers.

### Triggers

A **Trigger** is what activates a channel to send notifications. Echobell supports two trigger methods:

- **[Webhook](/docs/webhook)**: A URL endpoint that, when called via HTTP GET or POST, activates the channel. Perfect for integrating with monitoring systems, CI/CD pipelines, serverless functions, and any tool that can make HTTP requests.
  
- **[Email Trigger](/docs/email-trigger)**: A unique email address linked to the channel. When an email is sent to this address, the channel is activated. Ideal for email-based alerts, forwarding important messages, or systems that only support email notifications.

You can use both trigger types simultaneously on the same channel, giving you maximum flexibility in how you send alerts. Learn more about [webhook integration](/docs/webhook) and [email triggers](/docs/email-trigger).

### Notification Types

When subscribing to a channel, you can choose from different [notification styles](/docs/notification) that determine how alerts appear on your device:

- **Normal (Active)**: Standard app notification that appears in your notification center. Best for non-urgent updates and informational alerts.

- **Time Sensitive**: High-priority notification that can break through Focus modes and Do Not Disturb settings. Recommended for important alerts that need immediate attention but aren't critical emergencies.

- **Calling**: Call-like alert with ringtone and full-screen interface, similar to receiving a phone call. Essential for critical incidents requiring immediate response, such as production outages or security alerts.

The notification type you choose depends on the urgency of the channel's content. You can subscribe to the same channel multiple times with different notification types if needed. Read our [detailed guide on notifications](/docs/notification) to understand when to use each type.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Your Account

1. Download Echobell from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198)

### 2. Creating Your First Channel

1. From the main view, tap the button on the bottom right corner to navigate to the **Channels** view
2. Tap the **+** button to create a new channel
3. Enter a name for your channel (e.g., "Server Alerts")
4. Select a color to identify your channel
5. Configure your notification templates:
   - **Title template**: What appears as the notification headline
   - **Body template**: The detailed content of the notification
6. Optionally, toggle whether to subscribe the channel to yourself
7. Choose a **Notification Type** for your channel (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling)
8. Save your new channel

![Create Channel](/images/docs/screenshot-create-channel.en.webp)

### 3. Setting Up a Trigger

Once your channel is created, there are two ways to trigger notifications: via webhooks or emails. Tap the channel you just created to access its settings. In the channel settings, you can find the **Triggers** section.

#### Webhook Trigger

1. Tap the **webhook** button to copy the generated webhook URL
2. Integrate this URL into your systems (e.g., server monitoring, CI/CD pipeline)
3. When the URL is called, your channel will be triggered

You can provide variables to your notification templates in two ways:

```bash
# Example webhook call with query parameters
curl -X GET "https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id?server=production&status=critical&message=CPU%20usage%20at%2095%25"

# OR with JSON body
curl -X POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-unique-id \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"server": "production", "status": "critical", "message": "CPU usage at 95%"}'
```

These variables will be used to populate your notification templates. For example, if your title template is `{{server}} - {{status}}`, it would render as "production - critical".

**Special Variables:**

- `externalLink`: If you include this variable, it will be displayed as a clickable link in the notification records

#### Email Trigger

1. Tap the **email** button to copy the generated email address for your channel
2. When an email is sent to this address, your channel will be triggered

With email triggers, Echobell automatically extracts these variables from the email:

- `from`: The sender's email address
- `to`: The recipient's email address (your channel's email)
- `subject`: The email subject line
- `text`: The plain text content of the email
- `html`: The HTML content of the email

You can use these variables in your templates, such as `{{subject}}` or `{{text}}`.

### 4. Customizing Notification Templates

Templates use variables that are filled from the trigger data:

1. In your channel settings, go to **Notification Templates**
2. For the title template, you might use: `{{server}} - {{status}}`
3. For the body template, you could use: `{{message}} Detected at {{timestamp}}`
4. Variables are enclosed in double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`
5. Test your template with sample data

### 5. Subscribing to Channels

1. You can share the subscription link of your channels to others
2. Or you can use subscription links shared by others to subscribe to the channels
3. Tap **Subscribe** on the channels view
4. Enter the subscription link
5. Choose your preferred **Notification Type**:
   - Normal for standard alerts
   - Time Sensitive for important alerts
   - Calling for critical situations
6. Confirm your subscription

## App Settings

You can customize how Echobell handles notifications through these settings:

- **Repeat Voice Content**: When using call notifications, this setting will make the notification content repeat
- **Retry Failed Call**: Automatically retry call notifications that failed due to Focus Mode or other reasons

## Privacy and Data Storage

Echobell prioritizes your privacy:

- Only user accounts, channels, and subscription data are stored on our servers
- Notification content and history are stored locally on your device
- Your alert data never leaves your control
