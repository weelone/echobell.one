# Notifications in Echobell

Notifications are at the core of Echobell's functionality. This guide explains how notifications work, the different types available, and how to customize them for your needs.

## Notification Types

When subscribing to a channel, you can choose from three notification types based on urgency:

- **Normal**: Standard app notifications for routine alerts. These follow your device's normal notification settings.
- **Time Sensitive**: High-priority notifications that can break through certain focus modes. Use these for important alerts that shouldn't be missed.
- **Calling**: Call-like alerts for critical situations that demand immediate attention. These notifications appear as incoming calls on your device.

## Notification Templates

Each channel uses customizable templates for notification content:

- **Title Template**: Determines what appears in the notification header
- **Body Template**: Controls the main content of the notification

Templates support dynamic variables using the `{{variableName}}` syntax. For example:

```
Title: {{server}} status alert
Body: {{message}} detected at {{timestamp}}
```

## Variables in Notifications

### Webhook Variables

When triggering notifications via webhook, you can provide variables through:

- Query parameters: `https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxx?server=production&status=critical`
- JSON body:

```json
{
  "server": "production",
  "status": "critical"
}
```

Special Variables:

- `externalLink`: When included, creates a clickable link in the notification records view

### Email Variables

When triggering via email, these variables are automatically available:

- `from`: Sender's email address
- `to`: Recipient's email address
- `subject`: Email subject line
- `text`: Plain text content
- `html`: HTML content of the email

## Privacy and Storage

Echobell takes a privacy-first approach to notification handling:

- Notification content and history are stored exclusively on your local device
- Only essential data (user accounts, channel configurations, and subscriptions) is stored on servers
- Your notification data never leaves your control

## App Settings

Configure how notifications behave through these settings:

- **Repeat Voice Content**: For call notifications, enables repeating the notification content
- **Retry Failed Call**: Automatically retries call notifications that failed due to Focus Mode or other reasons

## Important Notes

- The app requires notification permission to function properly
- Notifications are delivered in real-time when channels are triggered
- You can receive notifications from both channels you create and channels you subscribe to
- Different notification types can be used for different levels of urgency
