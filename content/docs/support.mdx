We actually read and respond to every email (seriously!). When you email us:
- **Include your use case** - what are you trying to build?
- **Share your webhook/template setup** - helps us debug faster
- **Describe what's happening vs. what you expected** - be specific!

*Average response time: Usually within a few hours during business hours, definitely within 24 hours.*

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "My webhook isn't triggering notifications"

**Check these first:**
1. **Notification permissions** - Echobell needs permission to send notifications
2. **Channel subscription** - Make sure you're subscribed to the channel
3. **Webhook URL** - Verify you're using the correct webhook URL from channel settings
4. **Request format** - Try a simple GET request first: `https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-id?test=hello`

**Still not working?** Send us the exact webhook call you're making and we'll debug it together.

### "I'm getting notifications but the content is wrong"

This is usually a template variable issue:

**Quick fixes:**
- Check your template variable names match the data you're sending
- Remember variables are case-sensitive: `{{Server}}` is different from `{{server}}`
- Test with simple variables first, then build complexity

**Pro tip:** Email us your webhook payload and template - we love helping people craft perfect notification templates.

### "Notifications aren't coming through Do Not Disturb"

This is by design for most notification types:

- **Normal notifications** respect Do Not Disturb (as they should)
- **Time Sensitive** notifications break through DND during allowed hours
- **Calling notifications** will wake you up (use sparingly!)

**Need different behavior?** Let us know your use case - we're always improving how notifications work.

### "The app crashes or behaves weirdly"

**We want to fix this immediately:**
1. **Force close and restart** the app first
2. **Check for app updates** in the App Store
3. **Email us** with your device model, iOS version, and what you were doing when it crashed

*Crashes are our highest priority. We'll usually push a fix within days.*

## Tips for Getting the Best Help

### When something isn't working:
1. **Be specific** - "webhook doesn't work" vs "webhook returns 200 but no notification appears"
2. **Include context** - what are you building? what tools are you using?
3. **Share code/configs** - we can't debug what we can't see
4. **Mention your timeline** - need help urgently? just exploring? helps us prioritize
