# Integrating Echobell with TradingView

Echobell can be integrated with TradingView to receive notifications from your trading alerts. This guide will show you how to set up the integration.

## Prerequisites

- An Echobell account
- A TradingView account with webhook support (typically Pro/Pro+/Premium)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a channel in Echobell (get webhook URL)

1. Open the Echobell iOS app and create a new channel (e.g., "TradingView").
2. In channel details, copy the Webhook URL. Treat it as a secret.
3. Choose the channel's notification type (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling) based on urgency.

### 2. Configure TradingView Alert

1. Open TradingView and go to your chart
2. Create a new alert or edit an existing one
3. In the alert dialog:
   - Set up your alert conditions as needed
   - Scroll down to "Alert Actions"
   - Select "Webhook URL"
   - Paste your Echobell webhook URL
   - In the "Message" field, customize your payload (values used by templates in Echobell):

```json
{
  "title": "TradingView Alert",
  "message": "{{ticker}} hit {{price}}"
}
```

## Message Format

You can customize your notification using TradingView's variables:

- `{{ticker}}` - Symbol name
- `{{price}}` - Current price
- `{{volume}}` - Current volume
- `{{time}}` - Alert trigger time
- `{{exchange}}` - Exchange name
- `{{interval}}` - Chart interval

## Advanced Configuration

### Control Priority in Echobell

Echobell priority is controlled per channel, not by TradingView payload fields. To change urgency:

- Set the channel's notification type in the Echobell app: **Normal**, **Time Sensitive**, or **Calling** (see [/docs/notification](/docs/notification)).
- If you need different urgencies, create separate channels (e.g., "TV — Calls" and "TV — Push") and use the corresponding webhook URLs in different alerts.

Note: Custom notification sounds are not supported.

## Example Alert Templates

### Basic Price Alert

```json
{
  "title": "Price Alert",
  "message": "{{ticker}} is now at {{price}}"
}
```

### Volume Spike Alert

```json
{
  "title": "Volume Alert",
  "message": "High volume detected for {{ticker}}\nVolume: {{volume}}\nPrice: {{price}}"
}
```

### Trading Signal Alert

```json
{
  "title": "Trading Signal",
  "message": "{{strategy.order.action}} signal for {{ticker}}\nPrice: {{price}}\nTime: {{time}}"
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

1. After setting up your alert, you can test it by clicking the "Test" button in TradingView's alert dialog
2. You should receive a test notification in Echobell
3. Check your Echobell dashboard to confirm the webhook received the test payload

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving notifications:

1. Verify your webhook URL is correctly pasted in TradingView
2. Check if your alert conditions are properly configured
3. Ensure your Echobell account is active and notifications are enabled
4. Check your webhook logs in Echobell dashboard for any error messages

## Rate Limits

- TradingView free accounts have limited webhook calls
- Ensure your alert conditions are specific enough to avoid excessive triggers
- Consider upgrading your TradingView account for higher webhook limits
