# What is Echobell?

Echobell is an instant alert application designed to simplify notification management for developers, DevOps teams, and anyone who needs reliable, customizable alerts. It bridges the gap between your systems and your mobile device by handling webhooks and emails to trigger customized notifications or phone call-style alerts, ensuring you never miss important information.

Whether you're monitoring server infrastructure, tracking CI/CD pipelines, managing e-commerce operations, or coordinating team responses to critical events, Echobell provides a flexible, privacy-focused platform for instant notifications.

## Core Features

### Instant Alerts
Receive notifications in real-time when your channels are triggered. Whether it's a server outage, a failed build, or a critical business event, Echobell ensures the information reaches you immediately - typically within seconds of the trigger event.

### Multiple Trigger Methods
Set up **[webhooks](/docs/webhook)** or **[email-based triggers](/docs/email-trigger)** to fit your existing infrastructure:

- **Webhook Integration**: Perfect for modern cloud services, monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, and any system that can make HTTP requests
- **Email Triggers**: Ideal for legacy systems, email-based alerts, or forwarding important messages

Both trigger methods support passing custom variables that populate your notification templates.

### Customizable Notifications
Configure **[templates with dynamic variables](/docs/template)** to create informative, context-rich notifications. Instead of generic "Something happened" alerts, get specific information like "Production server CPU usage: 95%" or "Build #142 failed in deploy stage".

Templates support:
- Variable substitution with `{{variableName}}` syntax
- Object property access with `{{user.name}}`
- Array element access with `{{items[0]}}`
- Conditional expressions and logical operators

### Subscription System
Create channels and let others subscribe to them using secure, shareable links. Perfect for:
- Team-wide incident notifications
- Public status updates
- Collaborative monitoring
- Shared alerting channels

### Privacy-Focused Architecture
Only essential data is stored on our servers, while notification history stays on your device:

- **Stored on servers**: User accounts, channel configurations, subscription relationships
- **Stored locally**: Notification content, trigger history, alert records

This design ensures your sensitive operational data never leaves your control. Learn more in our **[privacy documentation](/docs/support#privacy)**.

### Advanced Filtering with Conditions
Use **[conditional expressions](/docs/conditions)** to filter which triggers actually send notifications. For example:
- Only alert when CPU usage exceeds 80%
- Filter by specific HTTP headers
- Notify only during business hours
- Alert based on complex logical conditions

This prevents alert fatigue by ensuring you only receive notifications that matter.

## How Echobell Works

Echobell operates on a simple but powerful workflow:

1. **Trigger Reception**: When a webhook is called or an email is received at a channel's unique address, Echobell's servers receive and validate the trigger.

2. **Data Processing**: The incoming data (query parameters, JSON body, or email content) is parsed and made available as variables.

3. **Condition Evaluation**: If the channel has **[conditions](/docs/conditions)** configured, they are evaluated against the trigger data. If conditions aren't met, the process stops here.

4. **Template Rendering**: The channel's **[notification templates](/docs/template)** are populated with the variables from the trigger, generating the final notification title and body.

5. **Notification Delivery**: The rendered notification is sent to all channel subscribers based on their chosen notification type (Normal, Time Sensitive, or Calling).

6. **Local Storage**: On the recipient's device, the notification record is stored locally with the rendered content, timestamp, and any associated links.

This architecture ensures fast delivery (typically under 1-2 seconds from trigger to notification) while maintaining privacy by keeping notification history on your device.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you have a production server being monitored by Prometheus:

1. CPU usage exceeds 90%
2. Prometheus sends a webhook to your Echobell channel with variables: `{server: "prod-01", cpu: 92, severity: "critical"}`
3. Your template "Server {{server}}: CPU at {{cpu}}%" renders as "Server prod-01: CPU at 92%"
4. The channel condition `cpu > 80` evaluates to true
5. All subscribers receive the notification instantly on their iPhones
6. If subscribed as "Calling" type, their phones ring like an incoming call

Learn how to set this up in our **[Prometheus integration guide](/docs/developer/prometheus)**.

## Key Concepts

### Channels

A channel is the core entity in Echobell. Each channel:

- Has a distinct name and color for easy identification
- Contains notification templates for title and body content
- Can be triggered via webhook or email
- Can be shared with others using subscription links

### Notification Types

When subscribing to a channel, you can choose from three **[notification types](/docs/notification)** that determine how alerts appear and behave on your device:

- **Normal (Active)**: Standard app notifications that appear in your notification center. Respects Do Not Disturb and Focus modes. Best for informational updates, non-urgent alerts, and general monitoring.

- **Time Sensitive**: High-priority notifications that can break through certain Focus modes. These appear prominently and are designed for important alerts that need attention soon but aren't critical emergencies. Examples: failed deployments, high resource usage, important business events.

- **Calling**: Call-like alerts with full-screen interface and ringtone, similar to receiving a phone call. These bypass all Do Not Disturb settings and are impossible to miss. Reserve these for critical incidents: production outages, security breaches, or emergency situations requiring immediate response.

The same channel can be subscribed to multiple times with different notification types if you want different urgency levels for the same alert source. For instance, you might subscribe to your production monitoring channel as "Time Sensitive" during work hours and "Calling" when you're on-call.

Read the complete **[notification guide](/docs/notification)** to understand when to use each type and avoid alert fatigue.

### Template Variables

Make your notifications dynamic by using variables in your templates:

```
Title: Server {{server_name}} is down!
Body: CPU usage reached {{cpu_usage}}%
```

When triggered with the appropriate variables, these templates generate personalized notifications.

### Triggering Methods

#### Webhook Triggers

Trigger channels via HTTP requests with variables in query strings or JSON bodies:

```http
GET https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxx?server_name=Production&cpu_usage=95

# OR

POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/xxx
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "server_name": "Production",
  "cpu_usage": 95
}
```

**Special Variables**

- `externalLink`: When included in the request, this variable will create a clickable link in the notification records view

#### Email Triggers

Send emails to channel-specific addresses. Echobell automatically extracts variables like:

- `from`: Sender's email address
- `subject`: Email subject line
- `text`: Plain text content
- `html`: HTML content

## Privacy and Data Storage

Echobell is designed with privacy in mind:

- Only user data, channel configurations, and subscription information are stored on our servers
- Notification history and records remain exclusively on your local device

  Echobell requires notification permission to function properly, as all features are notification-based. You'll be prompted to grant this permission when you first open the app.
