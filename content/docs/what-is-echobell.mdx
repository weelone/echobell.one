# What is Echobell?

Have you ever missed a critical production alert because it was buried under 47 other notifications? Or been woken up at 2 AM by a "low disk space" warning that could have waited until morning? We've been there too, and that frustration is exactly what led us to create Echobell.

**Echobell is the instant alert app that finally makes developer notifications work for you, not against you.** It transforms the chaotic stream of webhooks and emails from your systems into clear, actionable alerts that reach you at the right time with the right urgency level.

## The Problem We Solved

As developers and ops engineers, we live in a world of constant pings, alerts, and notifications. Slack messages, email forwards, PagerDuty alerts, Grafana notifications, GitHub webhooks - it never ends. The result? **Notification fatigue**. We start ignoring everything, which means we miss the alerts that actually matter.

Traditional notification systems treat everything equally. A successful deployment gets the same attention as a database outage. A code review request looks identical to a security vulnerability alert.

**Echobell changes this by giving you granular control over how and when you get interrupted.**

## What Makes Echobell Special

### Smart Notification Management
- **Instant webhook notifications** that turn any HTTP call into a perfectly formatted mobile alert
- **Email-to-notification bridges** that rescue important messages from email hell
- **Custom alert channels** organized by project, severity, or team
- **Intelligent urgency levels** - from quiet updates to "wake me up now" emergency calls

### Developer-First Design
- **Template-based notifications** using variables from your webhook payloads
- **Zero-configuration integrations** with tools like GitHub Actions, Grafana, and custom scripts
- **Team collaboration features** for sharing notification channels
- **Privacy-focused architecture** - your alert content never hits our servers

### Real-World Problem Solving
Instead of yet another dashboard to check, Echobell brings critical information directly to your phone, smart watch, or wherever you need it. It's the difference between discovering an outage from an angry customer email and catching it the second it happens.

## How Echobell Actually Works

Here's the magic: your systems (monitoring tools, CI/CD pipelines, custom scripts) send webhook requests or emails to Echobell. We process that data and instantly deliver formatted notifications to everyone subscribed to that channel.

**The flow is simple:**
1. Something happens in your system (deployment, error, threshold breach)  
2. Your system calls an Echobell webhook or sends an email
3. Echobell processes the data and applies your notification template
4. Formatted notifications are delivered to all subscribers instantly
5. You can take action immediately with all the context you need

**What makes it powerful:** The notification content is dynamically generated from the actual data your systems send, so instead of generic alerts, you get actionable information like server names, error codes, dashboard links, and specific metrics.

## The Building Blocks: Understanding Echobell's Core Concepts

### Channels - Your Notification Command Centers

Think of channels as smart notification pipelines, each designed for a specific purpose:

- **Unique identity**: Every channel has a name and color (because when you're troubleshooting at 3 AM, visual cues matter)
- **Smart templates**: Define exactly how raw data becomes actionable notifications
- **Flexible triggers**: Connect via webhooks for modern systems or email for legacy integrations
- **Team sharing**: Create once, share with anyone who needs those alerts

*Example: Your "Database Alerts" channel (red) might trigger calling notifications, while your "Deploy Updates" channel (green) sends normal notifications.*

### Notification Types - Matching Alerts to Reality

This is where Echobell shines. Not every alert deserves the same level of urgency:

- **Normal**: Standard push notifications for routine updates and non-critical information
- **Time Sensitive**: Breaks through Do Not Disturb for important but manageable issues
- **Calling**: Phone call alerts that will wake you up for true emergencies

*The key insight: YOU control the urgency level when you subscribe to a channel. The channel creator suggests, but you decide if their "critical" alert is worth waking you up.*

### Template Variables - From Raw Data to Clear Actions

This is where developer notifications get exciting. Instead of generic "something happened" alerts, you get rich, contextual information:

```
Title: ðŸš¨ {{environment}} database issues
Body: {{database_name}} response time: {{response_time}}ms
Query: {{slow_query}}
Dashboard: {{grafana_url}}
```

When your monitoring system triggers this with actual data, you get:
```
ðŸš¨ Production database issues
mysql-primary response time: 2,847ms  
Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE...
Dashboard: https://grafana.company.com/db/mysql
```

**Now that's an actionable alert.** You immediately know what's wrong, where to look, and how to fix it.

## How to Connect Your Systems

### Webhook Triggers - The Modern Approach

Perfect for any system that can make HTTP requests. Most monitoring tools, CI/CD platforms, and custom applications fit this category:

```bash
# Simple GET request with parameters
curl "https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-channel?server=web-01&status=DOWN&cpu=95"

# Rich POST with detailed JSON data
curl -X POST https://hook.echobell.one/t/your-channel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "server": "web-01",
    "status": "CRITICAL",
    "service": "nginx", 
    "error_count": 47,
    "dashboard": "https://grafana.company.com/d/nginx-overview"
  }'
```

**Pro tip:** Include a `externalLink` variable in your requests. It becomes a clickable button in your notification that takes you directly to dashboards, logs, or wherever you need to investigate.

### Email Triggers - The Universal Fallback

Some systems only speak email (looking at you, legacy monitoring tools from 2010). No problem:

1. **Every channel gets a unique email address** like `alerts-x8k9n@hook.echobell.one`
2. **Forward emails or configure systems** to send to this address
3. **Automatic variable extraction** gives you:
   - `from` - Who sent the alert
   - `subject` - Email subject line  
   - `text` - Plain text content
   - `html` - Rich formatted content

*This is incredibly useful for integrating with older systems or creating notification workflows for non-technical team members.*

## Privacy That Developers Actually Care About

We built Echobell's privacy model the way we'd want it if we were using it:

**What stays on our servers:**
- Your account information
- Channel definitions (names, templates, settings)
- Subscription lists (who's subscribed to what)

**What never touches our servers:**
- The actual content of your notifications
- Alert history and records
- Any sensitive data from your webhook payloads or emails

**Translation:** We know you have a channel called "Database Alerts" but we never see the notification that says "Production MySQL CPU at 95%". That data goes directly from our system to your device and stays there.

## Ready to Transform Your Alerts?

Getting started with Echobell takes about 5 minutes and will change how you handle system notifications forever:

1. **Download** the free Echobell app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6743597198)
2. **Sign in** with your email or Apple ID - whatever's easier for you
3. **Create your first channel** for something you already monitor
4. **Connect a webhook or email trigger** from your existing systems
5. **Experience** what intelligent notifications feel like

<Callout type="info">
**Quick start tip:** Begin with a non-critical channel like "deployment notifications" or "daily report summaries." Once you see how well it works, you can migrate your critical alerts.
